	<h1>Salone Abroad<h1>
	<p> exploring the stories of Sierra Leoneans around the world </p>

	<p>Salone Abroad is a creative digital project that explores the histories of Sierra Leoneans around the world. We work with individuals and groups to document their stories of moving and settling abroad. We use these stories as a basis to create artistic responses to share these stories and journeys with others.</p>

	<p>Our first stop will be in London!</p>

	<p>We will be meeting Sierra Leoneans who have made south London and its surrounding areas their base or home from home. We are looking for Sierra Leoneans who would like to share their stories with us. There is also an opportunity to get involved with the documentation process so will be providing oral history training with a group of volunteers. Interested in getting involved? Then complete our survey.</p>
