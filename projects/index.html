<h1> London </h1>

<p>Our first stop will be in London!</p>

<p>We will be meeting Sierra Leoneans who have made south London and its surrounding areas their base or home from home. We are looking for Sierra Leoneans who would like to share their stories with us. There is also an opportunity to get involved with the documentation process so will be providing oral history training with a group of volunteers. Interested in getting involved? Then complete our survey.</p>
